## Features
- **Multi-Exchange Support:** Monitors arbitrage opportunities across the 10 largest centralized exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, KuCoin, OKX, Bybit, Bitfinex, Huobi, Gate.io, Crypto.com).
- **DeFi Arbitrage:** Detects price differences between swap and liquidity pools on Solana and Ethereum L2s (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, zkSync).
- **Real-Time Opportunity Detection:** Continuously scans for profitable arbitrage trades and displays them in a user-friendly dashboard.
- **Automated Execution:** Optionally executes arbitrage trades automatically on behalf of the user, with customizable risk and profit thresholds.
- **Profit Estimation:** Calculates and displays potential profit for each opportunity, factoring in fees, slippage, and network costs.
- **Secure API Management:** Safely stores and manages user API keys for all supported exchanges and DeFi protocols.
- **Customizable Alerts:** Notifies users of new opportunities via dashboard, email, or messaging apps.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Tracks all trades, profits, and system actions for transparency and auditing.

## How It Works
1. **Data Aggregation:** The bot connects to exchange APIs and DeFi protocols to fetch real-time order book and pool data.
2. **Opportunity Analysis:** It compares prices, liquidity, and fees to identify arbitrage opportunities.
3. **Opportunity Display:** Opportunities are shown in a dashboard with details such as source/target, expected profit, risk level, and execution path.
4. **Automated Trading (Optional):** If enabled, the bot executes trades automatically, following user-defined parameters.

## Example Opportunity Table
| Type              | Asset      | Source Exchange/Pool | Target Exchange/Pool | Profit (%) | Est. Return (USD) | Risk   |
|-------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Cross-Exchange    | BTC/USDT   | Binance              | Coinbase             | 0.45       | $120.50           | Low    |
| DeFi Pool         | ETH/USDC   | Uniswap (Arbitrum)   | Sushiswap (Polygon)  | 0.62       | $98.30            | Medium |
| Solana Swap       | SOL/USDT   | Orca                 | Raydium              | 0.88       | $210.00           | High   |

## Profit Potential
The profit potential depends on market volatility, liquidity, and execution speed. In optimal conditions, the bot can identify multiple daily opportunities with profit margins ranging from 0.2% to 1.5% per trade. With sufficient capital and fast execution, users can potentially achieve daily profits of $100–$50,000 or more, depending on market conditions and risk appetite.

> **Note:** Actual profits may vary. All trading involves risk, and past performance is not indicative of future results.
